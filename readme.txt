Automatically finds keyword phrases and converts them into contextual in-text Clickbank affiliate links.

== Description ==

uContext is a free service that locates keywords in your content and turns them into affiliate 
links that take your visitors to contextually related Clickbank offers with your affiliate ID.  
Why make a couple cents per click when you could potentially make $15, $20, or more per sale 
with one of the most popular affiliate systems in the world.

You're in control. Unlike other in-text contextual advertising services, you decide how many 
links are created and what those links look like. Add your own Clickbank tracking ID and refine 
the criteria uContext uses to match offers.

uContext is a perfect solution for ad blindness. In-text links get clicked because they're right 
where your visitors are looking when they read your page content.

This is a great plug-in if you have a blog with lots of posts, or you have lots of blogs and need 
something quick, easy, and effective to monetize them.
