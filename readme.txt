Automatically finds keyword phrases and converts them into contextual in-text Clickbank affiliate links and auto-generates your Clickbank HopAd keywords.

== Description ==

uContext is a free service that locates keywords in your content and turns them into affiliate 
links that take your visitors to contextually related Clickbank offers with your affiliate ID. 
Why make a couple cents per click when you could potentially make $15, $20, or more per sale 
with one of the most popular affiliate systems in the world.

*** Now supports Clickbank HopAds as a widget *** 
As you may know, when you create your HopAd code at the Clickbank website you have to choose your 
keywords or any old random ads show up. But, what if each post in your blog has different keywords? 
Let uContext auto-fill with contextual keywords. All you have to do is get your HopAd code at 
Clickbank, paste the HopAd code in the uContext HopAd widget, and click save. That's it!

You're in control. Unlike other in-text contextual advertising services, you decide how many 
links are created and what those links look like. Add your own Clickbank tracking ID and refine 
the criteria uContext uses to match offers.

uContext is a perfect solution for ad blindness. In-text links get clicked because they're right 
where your visitors are looking when they read your page content.

This is a great plug-in if you have a blog with lots of posts, or you have lots of blogs and need 
something quick, easy, and effective to monetize them.
